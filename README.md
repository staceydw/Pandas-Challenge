Module 4 Challenge: Pandas-Challenge

In reviewing the school dataset, it is clear that there is a difference between charter schools and district schools in almost every measure. In terms of total school budgets, district schools have much larger amounts; however, due to the greater number of students in district schools, the budget per student is only slightly higher than that of the charter schools, which tend to have lower numbers of students. 

After reviewing the data for math and reading scores and the percentages of students who are passing each subject, charter schools have higher scores in every calculation. On average, charter school scores are approximately 10% higher than those of district schools when it comes to math and reading. Reading scores are higher than math scores in both charter and district schools. When it comes to overall passing scores, the difference between charter and district schools becomes quite stark, with charter schools out performing district schools by 40%. For the overall passing percentages, the majority of charter schools are around 90%, while districts hover just over 50%. 

One conclusion that can be drawn from this data is that the student to teacher ratio is lower at charter schools, allowing teachers to give more individual help to the students. This likely accounts for the higher test scores at charter schools. With district schools having a slightly higher budget per student, a lack of money does not account for the test scores, since that would have the opposite effect if it were a factor. 

Another conclusion that can be drawn from this is that the admission process for charter schools requires students to have high test scores in order to be admitted to the school. While charter schools don't require tuition, they are very desirable and only let in a small number of students. Not only are test scores a part of admissions, but students must live within a certain area. This is the same for districts, but charter schools tend to place themselves in more affluent areas, which could also account for the higher scores. It could also explain why a lower budget per student at charter schools doesn't impact scores, since parents in wealthier areas tend to donate time and money to their children's schools. 

In summary, the data presents the facts that charter school students have higher test score percentages than students in district schools for math and reading, as well as overall performance. 

Additional resources used for this challenge include ChatGPT for assistance calculating the average school spending per student, as well as debugging a "Future Warning" error code. 
Assistance was also received from a tutor in helping to identify an issue with some of the variables.
